### Expected Results

### Troubleshooting

#### Email Not Sending
- Check Resend API key is set in Supabase
- Verify function is deployed: `supabase functions list`
- Check function logs: `supabase functions logs send-review-email`

#### Form Not Working
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify all routes are properly configured in App.tsx
- Test individual components in isolation

#### Database Issues
- Check RLS policies allow inserts
- Verify table schema matches expectations
- Check Supabase logs for errors

### Performance Notes
